1. Customization
    resources/application.yml is the params file, you can change the username and password there.

2. Build a jar.
    I have already built a jar-file and placed it in the root folder.
    If you want to build a new one, you need perform the maven clean & install command, a new jar-file will be generated in the target folder.
